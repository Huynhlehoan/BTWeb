            <h3>  Overview </h3>
     <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Linear Smith Machines</b> 
        are the ultimate in weight machines and the LSM400
leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the
LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control associated
with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
for effective resistance. <br>

<i>You don't even need a workout partner</i>. Lock points
can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural
range of motion. <br>
You can tailor the LSM400 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the
basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a 
lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy
to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout without delay.   
The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight plates
<br>
The LSM400 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy
access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who want a quality home gym, but
do not have a lot of space. Place the LSM400 against a wall and you're ready
to go!
